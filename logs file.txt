■ Creating a Sample Log File
Use the `echo` command to simulate log entries and redirect them into a file:
#!/bin/bash
# Create a sample log file
echo "INFO: System started" > sample.log
echo "WARNING: Disk space low" >> sample.log
echo "ERROR: Failed to load module" >> sample.log
echo "INFO: Task completed" >> sample.log
■ Searching Logs with grep
Use `grep` to filter specific log levels from the file:
# Show all ERROR lines
grep "ERROR" sample.log
# Show all WARNING lines
grep "WARNING" sample.log
# Count how many INFO lines
grep -c "INFO" sample.log
